If you are expertise in Adobe Systems and graphics making then prepare well for the job interviews to get your dream job. Here's our recommendation on the important things to need to prepare for the job interview to achieve your career goals in an easy way. Database is a systematic collection of data and an electronic filing system. Databases helps in storing and manipulating the data. Databases are created in such a way that data is stored, retrieved, manipulated and deleted with operations. Follow Wisdomjobs page for Database job interview questions and answers page to get through your job interview successfully in first attempt. Question . Explain What Is Sqlite Transactions? Answer : The transaction is referred as a unit of work that is performed against a database. It is the propagation of one or more changes to the database.

Explain What Is The Use Of Sqlite Group By Clause? Answer : The SQLITE group by clause is used in collaboration with the SELECT statement to arrange identical data into groups. Question . When Is The Update_statistics Command Used? Answer : Question . Explain How Boolean Values In Sql Lite Are Stored? Answer : Boolean values in SQL lite are stored as integers (false) and (true). SQL Lite does not have a separate Boolean storage class. Question . Explain What Is Sql Lite? Answer : SQL LITE is a mostly ACID compliant relational database management system contained in a relatively small C programming library. Question . Give A Comment On Transaction? Answer : Question . List Out The Standard Sql Lite Commands? Answer : The standard SQL Lite commands interact with relational databases are similar to SQL. They are Based on their operational nature these commands can be classified. Question . Define The \"integrity Rules\"? Answer : There are two Integrity rules.Entity Integrity: States that \"Primary key cannot have NULL value\". Referential Integrity: States that \"Foreign Key can be either a NULL value or should be Primary Key value of other relation. Question . What Is Database? Answer : A database is a logically coherent collection of data with some inherent meaning, representing some aspect of real world and which is designed, built and populated with data for a specific purpose. Question . Segregate Database Technology’s Development? Answer : The development of database technology is divided into: Question . What Are The Features Of Database Language? Answer : A database language may also incorporate features like: Question . What Do Database Languages Do? Answer : As special-purpose languages, they have: Question . Define Database Model? Answer : A data model determining fundamentally how data can be stored, manipulated and organised and the structure of the database logically is called database model. Question .
